title: "Week 2 - Objects in the Proof, and Replica Symmetry Breaking"
event: Algorithmic Methods in Statistical Physics

math: true
subtitle: "[Antares Chen](https://antaresc.github.io/) University of Chicago"
summary: "[Antares Chen](https://antaresc.github.io/)"
abstract: "We discuss key mathematical objects that emerge from proving the Parisi Variational Principle: (1) replica symmetry breaking, (2) Guerra-Toninelli interpolation, (3) ultrametricity, (4) pure state decompositions, (5) the Ruelle Probability Cascades, and (6) the cavity method. We then introduce the Replica Method, and the Replica Symmetry Breaking ansatz."
