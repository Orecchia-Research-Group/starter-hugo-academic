title: "Week 5 - Replica Symmetry Breaking and Previewing the Proof"
event: Algorithmic Methods in Statistical Physics

math: true
subtitle: "[Antares Chen](https://antaresc.github.io/) University of Chicago"
summary: "[Antares Chen](https://antaresc.github.io/)"
abstract: "We work through the Replica method calculation under 1-RSB. We then sketch the transition from k-RSB to full-RSB, and in particular how the form of Parisi's variational principle falls as a consequence of the full-RSB estimate. We then discuss the historical development leading to a proof of the Parisi Variational Principle, previewing key mathematical objects along the way."
