title: "From (Sub)Gradient Flow Diffusions to Poincaré Inequalities in Graphs"
event: Theory Lunch

math: true
subtitle: "[Erasmo Tani](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~etani/) University of Chicago"
summary: "[Erasmo Tani](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~etani/)"
abstract: "The heat diffusion on a graph is a linear system of ODEs that has found several applications to graph partitioning. The process arises as the gradient flow of the Laplacian quadratic form potential with respect to the degree norm. In this talk we will introduce an alternative vertex-based diffusion process, and provide an analogue variational interpretation for it. We will also discuss how this suggests a framework for casting some graph properties as optimal constants for poincaré-type inequalities."
