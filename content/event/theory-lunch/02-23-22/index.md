subtitle: "[Juspreet Singh Sandhu](https://juspreetsandhu.me/) Harvard University"
summary: "[Juspreet Singh Sandhu](https://juspreetsandhu.me/)"
abstract: "We briefly give an overview of a recent result in which we obstruct all _local_ algorithms (classical or quantum) on almost all instances of _any_ constraint satisfaction problem that satisfies a peculiar property called the coupled-Overlap Gap Property. Our results rely on using some involved combinatorics and a martingale argument to prove strong concentration properties of a notion of local algorithm we term \"generic local\" - This notion subsumes local classical and local quantum algorithms.


The work is closely motivated by and/or tied to some interesting open questions at the intersection of Spin Glass Theory, Quantum inapproximability, Random & Algebraic Graph Theory and the Average-Case Complexity of CSPs. We mention some of these questions, which are currently ongoing work with collaborators at Bocconi University, ETH Zurich and University of Chicago.


Based on joint work with Chi-Ning Chou, Peter J. Love & Jonathan Shi."
