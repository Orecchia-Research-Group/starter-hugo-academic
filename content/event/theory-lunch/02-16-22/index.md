abstract: "Packing linear programs $$\\max \\\\{ \\langle c, x \\rangle : Ax \\leq b, \\\\, x \\geq 0 \\\\}$$ and their dual covering linear programs $$\\min \\\\{ \\langle b, y \\rangle : A^{\\top}y \\geq c, \\\\, y \\geq 0 \\\\}$$ are special cases of linear programming where the variables, coefficients, and constraints are non-negative. In this talk, we present some initial calculations that derive an algorithm for approximately solving packing and covering LPs via minimizing the duality gap -- the difference between the packing and covering objectives. An interesting aspect of our calculations is that the duality gap comes from reformulating the LP as a 2-v-2 game captured by a saddle point problem. Our algorithm emerges by requiring players of the game to adopt a specific strategy. However, other algorithms with potentially faster convergence rates may emerge by requiring players of the 2-v-2 game to adopt other strategies. Based on joint work with Lorenzo Orecchia, and Erasmo Tani."
