abstract: "Certified randomness is the ability to generate random bits that one can certify their randomness to a skeptic, without placing any trust in the experimental device. Recently Aaronson (Aaronson 2018, 2020) proposed a novel certified randomness protocol based on existing random circuit sampling experiments - placing this application within reach of near-term quantum devices. However, the security of Aaronson's protocol relies on non-standard conjectures that were not previously studied in the literature. In joint work with Roozbeh Bassirian, Adam Bouland, Bill Fefferman, and Sam Gunn, we prove two versions of Aaronsonâ€™s conjectures unconditionally in the black-box (aka, random-oracle) setting. 

In this talk, I will describe the setting and applications and give a brief proof outline of one of our results. The presentation will be self-contained and not assume much prior knowledge about quantum computing. "
