title: "Sampling, counting, and local central limit theorems"
event: Theory Seminar

#event_url:
math: true
subtitle: "[Will Perkins](http://willperkins.org/) University of Illinois at Chicago"
summary: "[Will Perkins](http://willperkins.org/)"
abstract: "I will describe how local central limit theorems (and Fourier-analytic proofs of local central limit theorems) can be used to design fast sampling algorithms and deterministic approximate counting algorithms for the number of independent sets and matchings of a given size in bounded degree graphs.  

Joint work with Vishesh Jain, Ashwin Sah, and Mehtaab Sawhney."
