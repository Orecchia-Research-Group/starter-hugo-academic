title: "Enumerating k-SAT functions"
event: Theory Seminar

subtitle: "[Yufei Zhao](https://yufeizhao.com/) Massachusetts Institute of Technology"
summary: "[Yufei Zhao](https://yufeizhao.com/)"
abstract: "How many k-SAT functions on n boolean variables are there? What does a typical such function look like?

Bollobás, Brightwell, and Leader conjectured that for each fixed k, almost every k-SAT function is unate.

In this talk, I will discuss progress towards this conjecture and explain how the hypergraph container method can be used to reduce the problem to a hypergraph Turán-like problem, which is solved for k ≤ 4 but remains open in general.

Joint work with Dingding Dong and Nitya Mani."
